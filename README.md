Network Programming
Network programming involves designing and implementing software that enables communication between devices over a network. This repository demonstrates how to work with networking protocols, sockets, and communication mechanisms. Below are key components for network programming in this project:

1. Socket Programming
TCP vs UDP: The primary methods for communication in networking are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). This project demonstrates both protocols, showcasing how to create reliable (TCP) and fast, connectionless (UDP) communication channels.

Creating a Socket: Sockets are the endpoints for sending and receiving data over a network. Both client and server applications need to create and manage sockets to establish communication.

2. Client-Server Model
Server: The server listens for incoming client connections on a specified IP address and port, handling multiple clients in some cases.

Client: Clients initiate a connection to the server, sending requests and receiving responses over the network.

3. Key Concepts
IP Address and Port: An IP address identifies the machine in a network, and the port is used to differentiate services on the machine.

Binding, Listening, and Accepting Connections: For a server to listen for incoming connections, it must bind to an address and port, then listen for connections. After a connection is made, the server accepts it, allowing data transfer.

Sending and Receiving Data: Once the connection is established, data is sent and received through the socket. In TCP, this ensures reliable data transfer with acknowledgment.

4. Error Handling
Timeouts and Retries: Network communication is subject to various issues, such as timeouts, dropped packets, or connection failures. Proper error handling, such as implementing retries or timeouts, is crucial to ensure reliability.

Handling Disconnections: Graceful handling of client or server disconnections is necessary to ensure data integrity and proper termination of communication.

5. Security Considerations
Encryption: Sensitive data should always be transmitted over encrypted channels (e.g., using SSL/TLS).

Authentication and Authorization: Always implement authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can communicate with your server.
